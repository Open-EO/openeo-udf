Here is a list of scientific paper that make use of neuronal networks to analyze satellite images:

Some of them are using pre-trained CNN like the VGG19 and VGG 16 NN available in pytorch.

There are training dataset available for land classification training:

6. Machine learning based hyperspectral image analysis: A survey
   https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08701

   Cite: "A bias-variance analysis in [201] found that random
          forest with embedded feature selection and Markov random field (MRF)
          based post-processing are best suited for hyperspectral data."

   Cite: "Wu et al. [302] showed that a convolutional RNN [332] (a network that
          has few convolutional layers followed by RNN) is better choice for spectra
          classification than LSTM and baseline CNN."

   Cite: "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAs)
          look very promising for modeling unlabeled hyperspectral data."

          "Deep learning based spatial prior could turn out to be better than
           Markov random fields based prior for land cover classification.
           GANs and VAs models for hyperspectral images should also prove to be good
           for image processing tasks, such as pansharpening, superresolution, denoising, and inpainting."

   Cite: "Another kind of data fusion would be to incorporate
          non-imaging data with imaging data. For instance, information from digital maps and geotagged user
          data could be used alongside information from remotely observed hyperspectral images for land cover
          mapping of urban areas. Due to their capabilities to model semantic relationships between different
          variables, conditional random models (CRFs) could be the best for this kind of fusion of information.
          In fact, recently a higher order CRF was used to model the dependencies between land use and land cover
          of a remotely imaged area [6]."

    https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07321

    Cite: "Even  though  some  literatures  have  made  advantages  of  deep  features  for
           RS  retrieval  task,  there  still  no comprehensive research on how to optimize
           the transferability of CNN models to RS retrieval.  With this in mind, we investigate
           almost all variables concerned to the property of CNN representations on several public
           HRRS datasets and analyze the effects of each factor."
